\section{Task}
For this assignment you are given the file {\tt SmartString.h} that contains the sample code. The tasks you need to accomplish are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item You will need to implement all the functions of the {\tt SmartString} class exactly like they have been declared in the header file.
\item  You cannot change the access specifiers of either the attributes or the functions.
\item You cannot add extra attributes to the class itself. The functions can have local variables.
\item Try to use functions inside one another to maximize code reuse.
\item You will need to define {\tt SmartString.cpp} and {\tt main.cpp}
\item All the functions of the {\tt SmartString} class must work in the main file
\item This is the last programming assignment, so do not forget to treat yourself once it is done!
\end{itemize}
